# Recyclerview with multiple view types

To implement something as shown in the screenshot we could use 2 recyclerviews. 
But, we want to use a single recyclerview with multiple view types. 

3 view types are:

    1. Category Section
    2. Movies Section
    3. Directors Section
 
 See the code how you can replicate the same. Enjoy coding 👨‍💻
